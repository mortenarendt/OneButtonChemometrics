Scripts for automated calibration

This repo contains a pipeline for a fully automated calibration pipeline handling outlier removal, selection of preprocessing, variable selection and selection of number of components for PLS modelling. 

The pipeline were developed as a benchmark to compare with the performance of manual modelling building conduted by more or less experienced chemometricians. 

The OB.m contains the pipeline, while the rest of the functionallity is engined by the PLS toolbox (Eigenvector Inc.)
